After successfully applying the K-map method, our focus now shifts to a more in-depth exploration of logic minimization. This project entails the implementation of the Quine McCluskey and Petrick's Method logic minimization approaches using C++.

### Project Details:

**Objective:** Implement Quine McCluskey and Petrick's Method for logic minimization in C++.

**Input Format:**
- First line: Describes input variables (up to 26 variables - a to z).
- Second line: Describes the output of the circuit.
- Third line: Non-minimized Boolean function in AND OR format.

**Output Format:**
- First two lines: Mirror the input descriptions.
- Third line: Illustrates the minimized Boolean function.

**Algorithm and Implementation Requirements:**
- Implement minimization using the Quine McCluskey and Petrick's Method.
