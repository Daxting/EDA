Projects about Electronic Design Automation (EDA):

## 1. Circuit Simulator
This project involved the development of a circuit simulator capable of accurately modeling and analyzing electronic circuits. The simulator was designed to provide real-time feedback and visualization of circuit behavior, helping users to understand complex electronic interactions and troubleshoot issues effectively.

## 2. Design Synthesis (using Karnaugh Map)
In this project, I utilized Karnaugh Maps for design synthesis, focusing on the simplification and optimization of logic circuits. This approach allowed for the reduction of the number of logic gates required, leading to more efficient circuit designs. The project demonstrated my ability to apply theoretical concepts to practical design challenges.

## 3. Logic Minimization (using Quine-McCluskey and Petrick’s Method)
This project centered on the logic minimization of digital circuits using the Quine-McCluskey algorithm and Petrick’s Method. These techniques were employed to minimize Boolean functions, thereby optimizing circuit performance. The project showcased my skills in advanced logic design and my proficiency in applying mathematical methods to engineering problems.
