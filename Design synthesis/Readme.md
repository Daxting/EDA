### Summary

**Background:**
- Design methodologies define hardware behavior.
- Automated synthesis tools are crucial for designing large integrated circuits.
- High costs of EDA tools drive companies to develop in-house synthesis tools.

**Project Overview:**
- *NCU* is developing a synthesis tool project to generate gate-level circuits automatically.
- The project is divided into stages; current focus is on integrating state table transformation and Karnaugh map minimization.

**Problem Description:**
- The *NCU* synthesis tool's flow diagram includes obtaining a state diagram, creating a state table, choosing flip flops, minimizing equations using Karnaugh map, and generating circuit design.
